Clone or download this repo and open a terminal into it.
You can now install via `./install.sh`  
Command line options :
* `-h` option to get a command line help, 
* `-g` to install system-wide rather than just for the current user (needs root privileges).
* `-r` to uninstall rather than install (can be used with `-g`)
By default, this script installs the theme for the current user only.
